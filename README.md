 # 🍽️ AI-Powered Recipe Book Web Application

An interactive and lightweight frontend web application that functions as an intelligent recipe book. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, while incorporating **React.js core concepts** such as **component-driven architecture**, **state management**, and **dynamic rendering**. The application utilizes **Google Gemini API** for AI-generated recipe content and integrates **Pixel** for generating high-quality, realistic dish imagery.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* 🧠 **AI-Generated Recipes**: Fetches contextual and creative recipes using **Google Gemini (Generative AI)**.
* 🖼️ **Dynamic Image Rendering**: Uses **Pixel image generation** APIs to produce dish visuals based on recipe content.
* ⚛️ **React Principles**: Implements React fundamentals such as **virtual DOM**, **JSX-like rendering**, and **props/state simulation** in vanilla JavaScript.
* 📱 **Responsive UI/UX**: Mobile-first, responsive design with clean CSS styling and intuitive layout.
* 🚀 **Asynchronous Data Handling**: Fetch API used to handle data from external services with proper error handling.
